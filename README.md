# Khorjin-IEC61850-90-5
Khorjin - An IEC 61850-90-5 Gateway for Synchrophasor Data Transfer with support for IEEE C37.118.2

This repository will be used to host the source and builds of the Khorjin library, which has been described in the references below.

## Release status
We hope to release Khorjin sometime *during 2017*. 

We are in the process of preparing a "Software X" journal paper to document the software, and in this process, we are clening it up for release. 

However, currently, we are lacking resources to finish up the preparation process to release the code, so if you want to help, please contact: luigiv@kth.se and/or srfi@kth.se
