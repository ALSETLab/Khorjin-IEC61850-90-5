# Khorjin-IEC61850-90-5
Khorjin - An IEC 61850-90-5 Gateway for Synchrophasor Data Transfer with support for IEEE C37.118.2

This repository will be used to host the source and builds of the Khorjin library, which has been described in the references below.

Because the original source code of Khorin did not include provisioning for security, a new version is under development as of Fall 2018 that can provide such features.

Original source of the prior version will be also released, but no support will be available.

## Release status
We hope to release Khorjin sometime in the future. Unfotunately, there have been many set-backs to find the opportunity to prioritize this work due to different constraints. As of February 2021, it there has not been any additional progress on this work.

Our original intent is still to prepare a "Software X" journal paper to document the software, and in this process, we will try to clen it up for release. 

Development is currently being lead by Mohammed Ilies Ayachi of KAUST and Luigi Vanfretti of RPI, please contact: mohammed.ayachi@kaust.edu.sa or luigi.vanfretti@gmail.com.
